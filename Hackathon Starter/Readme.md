# Welcome to Coding Club IITG's JS Hackathon 2018

## What’s a Hackathon?
Excerpt from Sendgrid (https://sendgrid.com/blog/judge-hackathon/)
A Hackathon is meant to bring developers together and have them build something. Hopefully, the developers learn something, meet new people, and have a good time in the process.
The purpose of a hackathon is not to create useful software, and some of the best most exciting hacks are utterly useless (e.g. The Homework Machine, Virtual Reality Nerf Gun, and a traffic cam tracker)

## What's different in this one?
-> guided hackathon, and only on frontend. Hence the 12 hrs duration.
-> live report card of your research. You'll submit a google sheet in which you'll enter the links to references you are using (not just visiting, but making some use of it for the hackathon). References can range from Tutorial videos to blogs to github repos,etc.
-> You’ll be posting progress in the group. Post the demo to below warm-up tasks as soon as you're done.

## Pre-requisites Checklist
- [ ] Have a github.io website to host the demo - Refer: http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
> Done the basic tasks in the Task poll (See session folders)

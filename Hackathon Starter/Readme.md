# Welcome to Coding Club IITG's JS Hackathon 2018

## What’s a Hackathon?
Excerpt from [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/judge-hackathon/):

A Hackathon is meant to bring developers together and have them build something. Hopefully, the developers learn something, meet new people, and have a good time in the process.
The purpose of a hackathon is not to create useful software, and some of the best most exciting hacks are utterly useless (e.g. The Homework Machine, Virtual Reality Nerf Gun, and a traffic cam tracker)

## What's different in this hackathon than usual ones?
1. It'll be a guided hackathon, you may contact the organisers for any help regarding the feasibilty of your idea and how you should implement it, or regarding any other issues.
2. There'll be a live report card of your research. You'll submit a google sheet in which you'll enter the links to references you are using (not just visiting, but making some use of it for the hackathon). References can range from Tutorial videos to blogs to github repos or anything!

3. You’ll be posting the progress on finishing some tasks in the group. Post the demo to below warm-up tasks as soon as you're done.

## What's expected to be done in this hackathon?
Since most of the participants are still beginners, we're focussing on learning more about JS.
The theme is to learn and extensively use jQuery and its plugins to create your application. Also, we are not particular about making something very innovative. What we really expect is a "Hacky" way to do something using JS, particularly JQuery.

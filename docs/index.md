# Welcome to Coding Club IITG's JS Hackathon 2018

## What’s a Hackathon?
Excerpt from [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/blog/judge-hackathon/):

A Hackathon is meant to bring developers together and have them build something. Hopefully, the developers learn something, meet new people, and have a good time in the process.
The purpose of a hackathon is not to create useful software, and some of the best most exciting hacks are utterly useless (e.g. The Homework Machine, Virtual Reality Nerf Gun, and a traffic cam tracker)

## What's different in this hackathon than usual ones?
1. It'll be a guided hackathon, you may contact the organisers for any help regarding the feasibilty of your idea and how you should implement it, or regarding any other issues.
2. There'll be a live report card of your research. You'll submit a google sheet in which you'll enter the links to references you are using (not just visiting, but making some use of it for the hackathon). References can range from Tutorial videos to blogs to github repos or anything!
Fill this form: [https://goo.gl/forms/8dsraViC2YptyaeP2](https://goo.gl/forms/8dsraViC2YptyaeP2)
3. You’ll be posting the progress on finishing some tasks in the group. Post the demo to below warm-up tasks as soon as you're done.

## What's expected to be done in this hackathon?
Since most of the participants are still beginners, we're focussing on learning more about JS.
The theme is to learn and extensively use jQuery and its plugins to create your application. Also, we are not particular about making something very innovative. What we really expect is a "Hacky" way to do something using JS, particularly JQuery.

### Revision material
You can go through the session-wise folders in the repo : [https://github.com/Udayraj123/webdworkshop/](https://github.com/Udayraj123/webdworkshop/)

## Flow of the things you'll do
1. Warmup Tasks
2. Ideation
3. Discussion and Research
4. Implementation
5. Documentation and Live Demo 

### Warm-up Tasks (45 minutes)
- [ ] Make your github.io website - Refer: [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

For each of the tasks below, one team member has to post the link to the solution in the fb group. First to post gets more credits.
- [ ] Table Creator
- [ ] LED Grid

### Ideation
Squeeze out your brains to think of a kickass idea. Remember the definition of hackathon though!

*Pro Tip*: Use the Creativity App : [Playstore Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.jolusan.creativitybasic&hl=en)

Also, take a read at this : [Cool things with JS](https://www.quora.com/What-cool-things-can-I-make-with-JavaScript)

### Discussion and Research
Once you have a workable idea, you can discuss it within yourselves or with the volunteers on its feasiblity in less than 11 hours, and you shall start searching for the right tools to use to code it. Don't forget to put links to everything you research into the google sheet (Note: you can Ctrl + D the pages, and then put them into the sheet in bulk from Bookmarks Manager)

### Implementation
Now you can stay at the Hall, or goto your room for implementing your idea. The volunteers will be available online all the time. Make sure to create a new (& private until the end of hackathon) github repository for your hackathon project.

### Documentation and Live Demo
Whenever one team member is free, he/she should start with the documentation. Follow this guide: https://blog.github.com/2016-08-22-publish-your-project-documentation-with-github-pages/. Also note that the live demos should be placed in the `docs` folder of your project repo.

## What everyone must learn today?
1. You have to learn and use atleast 3 Jquery plugins (may refer: https://tutorialzine.com/2013/04/50-amazing-jquery-plugins and https://github.com/petk/awesome-jquery)
2. Intermediate level use of Git (Team members shall make [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to master repo, make documentations, etc)

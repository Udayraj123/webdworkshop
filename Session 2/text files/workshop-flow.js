Final Discussion -
1. Tips -
	a. Be active in the group, share whatever good things you find and maybe I'll teach you how its done.
		-> Make sure to fill the polls. 
	b. Start "Expecting" things to exist. the methods (like .appendChild, than innerHTML), the templates, the js scripts, even utility tools/shortcuts
	c. Again, practice speed typing. If anything that has helped me THROUGHOUT the years till my third year, its speed typing
2. Tasks
